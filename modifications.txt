API Specification Updates

This document outlines the required changes to the API specification to address validation issues and ensure proper handling of nullable fields.
1. Fix Duplicate Enum Values in ConditionType (EDM-1249)

    Problem: The ConditionType enum contains duplicate values ('Approved' and 'Accessible') for different contexts.
    Solution: Replace the duplicate values with more specific names to avoid conflicts.

2. Allow null for Optional Fields in DevicesSummary (EDM-851)

    Problem: Fields like applicationStatus, summaryStatus, and updateStatus are not nullable, but they may return null in certain cases.
    Solution: Add nullable: true to allow these fields to be null.

3. Nullable Fields in CertificateSigningRequestSpec (EDM-852)

    Problem: The request and signerName fields in the CertificateSigningRequestSpec are sometimes returned as null but are not marked as nullable.
    Solution: Add nullable: true to both fields to support null values.
